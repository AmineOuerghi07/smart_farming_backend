# Smart Farming Backend

## Description

This academic project was built using Nest.
This project consists of a backend solution for a Smart Farming [Mobile Application](https://github.com/AmineOuerghi07/DreamCraftPim) using Microservices Architecture, docker for containerization, k8s for orchestrating, grafana prometheus for monitoring the performance and the load on server and finally some blockchain using ganache just to test it locally 

## Project setup

First Clone the branch master or amine_branch using this command 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AmineOuerghi07/smart_farming_backend.git
# or
$ git clone -b "amine_branch" https://github.com/AmineOuerghi07/smart_farming_backend.git

```

Then run the project using docker so you won't need to setup any third party softwares or libraries as it simplifies everything.

### Of course you need to have docker in order to run these images

## Build images and run the project

```bash
# building the images
$ docker compose build

# Running the container
$ docker compose up -i

# Stopping the container
$ docker compose down

```
